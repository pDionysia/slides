## PART A — CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS (Bare Si Wafer)

Measurement Plan (Chemicals Only):

- Chemicals: Ethanol, Metalaxyl, Acetamiprid, Abamectin

- Concentrations: 10 ppb → 100000 ppb

- 5 measurements per concentration

# Data Format

![Histogram](figures/data_format.png)

--

- Time delay → when each part of the pulse arrives
- THz electric field → how strong the pulse is at that moment

Together, they give the full time-domain waveform, which contains all the information about:

- the sample

- the chemicals

- the SRRs

- how they modify the THz wave

# Comparing Chemicals

## PART B — METAMATERIAL MEASUREMENTS (SRRs)

- SRRs: tiny metal rings with a gap
- They behave like small antennas that have a specific resonant frequency in the THz range

- When something changes around them (like a chemical being deposited ) their resonance shifts, and we can measure that

# Key Takeaways

- We collected THz time-domain signals from two types of samples: the pure chemicals on silicon, and later the SRR metamaterial structures
- The chemical-only data show how each chemical and each concentration changes the THz pulse (its shape, amplitude, and timing)
- The SRR data show how the metamaterial responds to its environment (first clean, then with ethanol) revealing how its resonance shifts in the THz range

Next step:
- SRR data placing different concentration of chemicals
