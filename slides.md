#  Why Time Series Classification?

Time series data is everywhere:

- Health (ECG)

- Finance (stocks)

- Wearable sensors

Traditional methods:

- NN-DTW

- HIVE-COTE (accurate but slow/complex)

---

# Why Deep Learning?

- Huge success in images, speech, text

- Learns features automatically

- Question: Can it match or beat state-of-the-art TSC methods?

# Key Findings

- Deep learning models outperform NN-DTW

- Comparable to HIVE-COTE

- Much faster and scalable

- Good on multivariate data

- Sensitive to initialization
---

# Interpretability

Black-box problem in DNNs

- Solution: Class Activation Maps (CAM)

- Highlights important time steps

- Improves trust

# Conclusions

Deep learning is effective:

- High accuracy

- Scalable

- Less manual feature engineering

Challenges remain:

- Overfitting

- Interpretability

- Transfer learning
